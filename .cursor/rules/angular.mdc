### Guidelines for ANGULAR

#### ANGULAR_CODING_STANDARDS

- Use standalone components, directives, and pipes instead of NgModules
- Implement signals for state management instead of traditional RxJS-based approaches
- Use the new inject function instead of constructor injection
- Implement control flow with @if, @for, and @switch instead of *ngIf, *ngFor, etc.
- Leverage functional guards and resolvers instead of class-based ones
- Implement deferrable views to delay rendering of non-essential components until they're needed
- Implement OnPush change detection strategy for improved performance
- Use TypeScript decorators with explicit visibility modifiers (public, private)
- Leverage Angular CLI for schematics and code generation
- Apply immutability principles and pure functions wherever possible, especially within services and state management, to ensure predictable outcomes and simplified debugging.
- Favor component composition over inheritance to enhance modularity, enabling reusability and easy maintenance.
- Use descriptive variable names like `isUserLoggedIn`, `userPermissions`, and `fetchData()` to communicate intent clearly.
- Enforce kebab-case naming for files (e.g., `user-profile.component.ts`) and match Angular's conventions for file suffixes (e.g., `.component.ts`, `.service.ts`, etc.).
- Define data models using interfaces for explicit types and maintain strict typing to avoid `any`.
- Utilize trackBy functions with `ngFor` to optimize list rendering.
- Prevent XSS by relying on Angular's built-in sanitization and avoiding `innerHTML`.
- Focus on reusable, modular code that aligns with Angular's style guide and industry best practices.
- Refer to Angular's official documentation for components, services to ensure best practices and maintain code quality and maintainability.
