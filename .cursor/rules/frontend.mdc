## Frontend

### General Guidelines

- Use Astro components (.astro) for static content and layout
- Implement framework components in Angular only when interactivity is needed

### Guidelines for Styling

#### Tailwind + PrimeNG / PrimeUI

- Use Tailwind utilities (flex, grid, gap-*, p-*, m-*, w-*, etc.) to compose layouts around PrimeNG components instead of writing raw CSS
- Use PrimeNG components as the primary UI building blocks and avoid recreating them with plain HTML + Tailwind unless strictly necessary
- Use PrimeUI / tailwindcss-primeui tokens (e.g. bg-surface-*, text-surface-*, border-surface-*, text-primary) to keep custom elements visually consistent with the active Prime theme
- Use the @layer directive (e.g. @layer base) and @apply for cross-cutting base styles like body, a, and headings, only with valid Tailwind / tailwindcss-primeui utilities
- Treat the selected PrimeUI theme as the single source of truth for colors, radii, and shadows, and avoid introducing a parallel Tailwind-only color system that diverges from Prime
- Prefer Prime’s theming options and CSS variables for deep visual customization of PrimeNG components, using Tailwind mainly for spacing, alignment, and container backgrounds around them
